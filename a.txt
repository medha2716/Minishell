NAME
       sleep - delay for a specified amount of time
SYNOPSIS
       sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]...
       sleep OPTION
DESCRIPTION
       Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the default),
       'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.  Unlike most  implemen-
       tations  that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER may be an arbi-
       trary floating point number.  Given two or more  arguments,  pause  for
       the amount of time specified by the sum of their values.
